Hereâ€™s a formatted document for the solution to the "Failed to connect to repository" error due to DNS resolution issues:

---

# **Fix: "Could not resolve host: github.com" in Jenkins/Git**

## **Error Description**  
The error occurs when Jenkins (or the system) cannot resolve the DNS for `github.com`, preventing access to the Git repository.  

### **Error Message**  
```
Failed to connect to repository: Command "git ls-remote -h -- https://github.com/rk4027-N/one.git HEAD" returned status code 128:  
stdout:  
stderr: fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/rk4027-N/one.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com
```

## **Root Cause**  
The system is missing or misconfigured DNS settings (`/etc/resolv.conf`), leading to domain resolution failure.

---

## **Solution**  

### **Step 1: Fix DNS Resolution**  
Create or modify `/etc/resolv.conf` with valid DNS nameservers (e.g., Google DNS):  

```bash
sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf <<EOF
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
EOF
```

### **Step 2: Verify Connectivity to GitHub**  
Check if `github.com` is now reachable:  

**Option 1: Ping Test**  
```bash
ping -c 3 github.com
```  

**Option 2: Curl Test**  
```bash
curl -v https://github.com
```  

### **Step 3: Retry Jenkins/Git Operation**  
Once DNS works, Jenkins should be able to clone the repository.  

---

## **Troubleshooting**  
If `/etc/resolv.conf` keeps getting deleted/overwritten:  
- **Systemd-based distros (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.):** Configure `systemd-resolved` or `NetworkManager`.  
- **Manual Persistence:** Make the file immutable (use `chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf`).  

**Specify your Linux distribution for further help.**  

---

### **Document Summary**  
- **Issue:** DNS resolution failure preventing Git/Jenkins from accessing GitHub.  
- **Fix:** Configure `/etc/resolv.conf` with valid nameservers.  
- **Verification:** Test connectivity using `ping` or `curl`.
